# Quantum Computing

Before we dive deeper into the world of Quantum Computing, we must understand what it is and the advantages it offers.

Quantum Computing is a technology being developed which is able to capture and utilize the power of Quantum Mechanics, allowing us to solve computation problems which is difficult for Classical Computing to solve. But a certain limitations with Quantum Computers are the cost to setup + inability to solve problems which cannot be solved by Classical Computers.

**This repository demonstrates the capability of Quantum Computers using user-defined and module-defined algorithms.**
